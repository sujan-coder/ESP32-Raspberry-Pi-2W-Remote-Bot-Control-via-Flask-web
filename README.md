# ESP32-Raspberry-Pi-2W-Remote-Bot-Control-via-Cloudflare-Tunnel-
This project demonstrates how to control a two-wheel robot remotely using: 
ESP32 → Drives motors via L298N motor driver. 
Raspberry Pi 2W → Acts as a controller, relays commands via UART.  
Flask Web App → Provides a simple web interface with buttons for motion control.  
Cloudflare Tunnel → Exposes the Pi’s web server to the internet.
